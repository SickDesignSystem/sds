/**
 * Heading styles come in a range of sizes, and can be used in a range of contexts, such as:
 * <br />
 * <ul>
 * <li>building page hierarchy,
 * <li>helping users scan large chunks of text,</li>
 * <li>providing a title to a page or piece of content,</li>
 * <li>as subheadings or eyebrow headings, where there is still only one H1 tag per page (as per Accessibility requirements).</li>
 * </ul>
 * <br />
 * Our heading styles are consistently bold, to better address the visual hierarchy.
