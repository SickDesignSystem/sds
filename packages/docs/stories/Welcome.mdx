# Synergy Design System ![](/heart.svg)

Welcome to the Synergy Design System: the centralized, living style guide for [SICK](https://www.sick.com) application user interfaces.

Synergy gives you a head start for your application. Use colors, styles, components and assets to quickly spin-up your application in development ✍ and design 🎨 at the same time.
Build multiple apps with different frameworks sharing the same UI components.

## Offering 🎂
- Components, Design-Tokens, Templates and Assets
- Modular and flexible UI components which can be put together like Lego blocks.
  - 🪞 The components exist twice; as web- (development) and as Figma-components (design) which are always in-sync and have the exact same anatomy.
  - 🧩 [Angular](https://angular.io), [React](https://react.dev) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org) are first-class citizens. Due to the nature of web-components which are framework agnostic they run in all frameworks or without any. But we decided to give special support to those popular frameworks so they profit from better DX.
  - ♿️ The web-components are accessible (A11Y)
- ✐ Auto-completion in TS, JS and HTML (VSCode)
- 🎨 Customizability: easy and profound options for styling and branding via DesignTokens, CSS Variables and CSS Parts.
- 🌛 Light and dark themes are included
- Material icons
- 🌍 Support for all major browsers; tested with every release.
- Basic CSS styles for an easy application start
- Templates for typical and recurring UIs which can be copied.

## Foundations 🧱
- The [web-components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) are build upon popular technologies, especially [Lit](https://lit.dev) and [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style) 🙏
- [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) from Google 🙏

## Trust 🤝
Using a base library for an application is and should be a careful and very well-considered process. Besides the technology stack and features another key factor is trust.
Why do we think you should trust Synergy?
- We also considered our base technologies very carefully and decided for the ones which are most popular and easy to maintain if necessary
- We are building on web standards
- Every used technology is independent from other technologies as much as possible and meaningful
- In development, dependencies are updated on a regular basis
- It is our aim to provide a long lasting library with a stable API.
- Synergy has a dedicated team with almost a single responsibility into this project
- All team members are very experienced designers and web developers with a long history in developing design systems
- Synergy is backed by big and strategically important products at SICK
- Synergy is seen by top management as a very important corner stone for a successful and versatile product palette
- We are putting a lot of effort into quality assurance
- We are listening very carefully to our stakeholders needs
- We made everything transparent: code (open source), roadmap, issues, aims, guidelines, decision, ...
