### Main Colors

Colors are an essential factor for the success of a brand.
In combination with the logo and typography, colors create a visual identity and thus a unique brand image.
SICK is identified by the colors blue, gray, orange and white. It is important that the color scheme is used consistently â€“ especially for an international company like SICK.

Our main colors emphasize interface elements such as buttons, links and to highlight elements on the page.
