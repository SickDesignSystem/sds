### Secondary colors

Our secondary palette contains a variety of colors to keep things fresh and interesting.
It is mainly used to visualize (technical) product specific information of SICK products.
It is not allowed to use within marketing content or for UI elements.
A great example is the visualization of the sensor light beams.
These colors must not be more dominant than our main colors above.
