# Color

**The use of color in our interfaces help convey meaning, hierarchy, and accessibility to our products.**

    colors={[
      tokens.sdsColorPrimaryPrimary500,

## Guideline

### Color is purposeful

Although we value an appealing use of color, we place a higher value on clear communication.
Our use of color should be purposeful, rational, and should support the purpose of the content.
It is also important to note that color alone is not always enough to convey meaning but it can help support the intended message.

### Color supports hierarchy

The use of color should help bring attention to what matters most.
Color should support the hierarchy of the page.
We use color sparingly and purposefully to draw focus and attention for the user.

### Color should be accessible

When choosing colors, consider users who are color blind or who have low vision.
Never use color alone to convey information.

We strive to comply with AA standard contrast ratios when using combinations of text colors in our product interfaces.
This helps to provide accessible interfaces for a wide range of our users, increasing usability and readability.
If you see a AA compliant color listed below, this means the background of this color contrasts well against the defined text color.
