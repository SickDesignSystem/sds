# Introduction of the Synergy Design System

## Guiding principles

Synergy Components are part of the Solid Design System, serving as a robust foundation for SICKS digital presence, built upon three core principles which should be kept in mind by designers, developers and stakeholders.

### ⚓️ Anchored – Robust yet Adaptable
“We build on top of foundations from trusted vendors and proven standards, to focus on what's relevant for our brand and users.”

### 🤝 Unified – Building Together, Always
“As devs and designers we shape a single product by learning from and being responsible for each other.”

### 🔮 Progressive – Guiding into Tomorrow
“We respect our current and future users, by supporting flexible usage while reducing complexity."

These principles help us to achieve our goals.


## Vision and goals

### Vision
Synergy is a unified design system that empowers teams to create beautiful, user-friendly, adaptable and accessible products across all digital platforms.
It acts as a central reference point, enabling teams to stay aligned and efficiently create high-quality and consistent interfaces that adhere to our brand values.
The design system serves as a hub for defining, documenting, and distributing design standards, style guides, pre-built components, patterns, and tools throughout the organization.
It is an evolving system that continually adapts and improves to meet the needs of our teams and users. Additionally, Synergy is a collaborative and open system, where teams can share and reuse components, patterns, and best practices.
